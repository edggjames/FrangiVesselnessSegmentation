function If = gaussian_imfilter_sep(I, p, q, sigma)
% GAUSSIAN_IMFILTER_SEP filters an image using a nth order derivative 
% Gaussian kernel taking advantage of the separability property (i.e. by
% performing a series of 1D convolutions).
%
%
% DESCRIPTION: If = gaussian_imfilter_sep(I, p, q, sigmax, sigmay)
%       Filters an image matrix, I, using a separable Gaussian kernel of 
%       width, sigmax/sigmay, and derivative order, p/q (in x and y
%       directions, respectively).
%
% INPUTS:
%       I (double matrix) - image to be filtered.
%       
%       p (integer scalar >= 0) - order of derivative in x-direction
%                                (The values of a zero-mean Gaussian function
%                                are evaluated when p = 0)
%
%       q (integer scalar >= 0) - order of derivative in y-direction
%                                (The values of a zero-mean Gaussian function
%                                are evaluated when q = 0)
%
%       sigma (double scalar)  - Standard deviations in each direction of
%       the Gaussian Kernel (determines the width or scale of the Gaussian)
%     
% OUTPUTS:
%       If (double matrix) - Filtered image
% 
% NB: For 2D images, x is in the direction of increasing column
%           index (i.e. left to right), and y is in the direction of
%           increasing row index (i.e. top to bottom);
%
% NB: 
%   1) When p or q is zero, a gaussian blurring filter is applied in the
%      relevant direction
%   2) When p or q is one, an edge detector filter is applied in the
%      relevant direction, which peaks at an edge
%   3) When p or q is two, a Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) edge detector
%      filter is applied, which has a zero crossing at an edge.
